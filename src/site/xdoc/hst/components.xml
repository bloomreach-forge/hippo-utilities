        <p>BaseComponent gets local parameters 'cssclass' and 'id' from configuration
          and sets any values on the request under the same attribute names.</p>
      </subsection>
      <subsection name="org.onehippo.forge.utilities.hst.component.Container extends BaseComponent">
        <p>Container is used for dynamic rendering of HST component in your jsp.</p>
        <p>HST version 2.04 and up has a hst:defineObjects tag to render all child components in the order they are
          configured. Container supports rendering child components in a custom order.</p>
        <p>It reads the child component names and sets the values on the request
        under the attribute name 'includes', which is a list. </p>
        <p>Beforehand, it sorts the component child names alphabetically. Derived classes
          can adjust the sorting by configuring a 'sorting' parameter and implementing
          a sort algotythm.</p>
        <p>In the frontend, the child includes can be used in the &lt;hst:include&gt; tag as follows:</p>
        <source><![CDATA[
  <c:forEach var="include" items="${includes}">
    <hst:include ref="${include}" />
  </c:forEach>]]></source>
