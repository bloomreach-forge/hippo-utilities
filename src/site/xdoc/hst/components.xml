  <body>
    <section name="HST Base Components">
      <subsection name="org.onehippo.forge.utilities.hst.component.BaseComponent extends BaseHstComponent">
        <p>BaseComponent gets local parameters 'cssclass' and 'id' from configuration
          and sets any values on the request under the same attribute names.</p>
      </subsection>
      <subsection name="org.onehippo.forge.utilities.hst.component.Container extends BaseComponent">
        <p>Container is used for dynamic rendering of HST component in your jsp.</p>
        <p>HST version 2.04 and up has a hst:defineObjects tag to render all child components in the order they are
          configured. Container supports rendering child components in a custom order.</p>
        <p>It reads the child component names and sets the values on the request
        under the attribute name 'includes', which is a list. </p>
        <p>Beforehand, it sorts the component child names alphabetically. Derived classes
          can adjust the sorting by configuring a 'sorting' parameter and implementing
          a sort algotythm.</p>
        <p>In the frontend, the child includes can be used in the &lt;hst:include&gt; tag as follows:</p>
        <source><![CDATA[
  <c:forEach var="include" items="${includes}">
    <hst:include ref="${include}" />
  </c:forEach>]]></source>
      </subsection>
      <subsection name="org.onehippo.forge.utilities.hst.component.ForwardComponent extends BaseHstComponent">
        <p>Component that does a forward on the response base on the component configuration parameter named 'forward'.
          The parameter should reflect a site map path starting with a "/" and is relative to the root of the HST sitemap.
        </p>
      </subsection>
      <subsection name="org.onehippo.forge.utilities.hst.component.RedirectComponent extends BaseHstComponent">
        <p>Component that does a redirect on the response or on the component, based on the component parameters 'type'
          (value 'response' or 'component') and 'redirect' (site map path).
        </p>
