    <section name="What does it do">
      <p>The search input util "cleans" up a free text search input string. What it does:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Clean up whitespace characters "&#160;&#160;this&#160;&#160;&#160;is&#160;&#160;too&#160;much space&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;" becomes "this is too much space" </li>
        <li>Limit the search string to 250 characters</li>
        <li>Limit the amount of wildcard characters per search query "**Is this *not* efficient?" becomes "Is this *not efficient"</li>
        <li>Removes special search words like "AND " and  "OR "</li>
        <li>Translates "NOT " into Lucene syntax "-"</li>
      </ul>
