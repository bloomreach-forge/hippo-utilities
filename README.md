# Hippo Utilities

The Hippo Utilities forge project contains generic code for reusage, in order to avoid code being copied from project 
to project.

# Documentation 

Documentation is available at [onehippo-forge.github.io/hippo-utilities](https://onehippo-forge.github.io/hippo-utilities)

The documentation is generated by this command:

 > mvn clean site:site
 
The output is in the docs directory; push it and GitHub Pages will serve the site automatically. 


## DEMO TODO
- if existing, move demo project in SVN as submodule in Git

## OLD SVN TODO
- first remove all docs, just one page pointing to the new docs (above)
- remove trunk content and add README.txt with "Moved to https://github.com/onehippo-forge/REPO_NAME"
